## Notes from Maggie's Auto:

to do: Auto 

auto fine tuning done (odo pods w/ hair AHHAH)

more fine tuning with fixed odo pods

MORE AUTO PATHS in 30 SECONDS 

current: 

push pixels then park


Need:

push pixels, place pixel (Left, middle, right)

place pixel, intake pixel repeat 

park


-push pixel left, place pixel left, intake repeat, park

-push pixel right, place pixel right, intake, repeat, park

-push pixel middle, place pixel middle, intake, repeat, park


coords for backdrop placement 

coords for before backdrop placement?

auto code for arm and claw placement 

3 pixel placement (green, yellow, purple, all purple/green/yellow)



coords for intake (white spikes)

pathing back to backdrop 



coords for bot placement for drone 



IDEAL PATTERNED PATH

push pixel (left, middle, right)

go place pixel (left, middle, right)

go back to intake pixel (under stage door)

go back to place pixel (under stage door/ over to the wall 
(circular))
